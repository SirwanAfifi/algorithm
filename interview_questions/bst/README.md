## Directions

### Binary Search Tree

- Every node can have at most two children
- Some nodes can have left and right nodes
- Every single value to the left of the parent node has a value less than parent
- Every single value to the right of the parent node has a value greater than parent

### Types of questions about BST:

- How to add a node to an existing BST?
- How to validate a BST?

1.  Implement the Node class to create
    a binary search tree. The constructor
    should initialize values 'data', 'left',
    and 'right'.
2.  Implement the 'insert' method for the
    Node class. Insert should accept an argument
    'data', then create an insert a new node
    at the appropriate location in the tree.
3.  Implement the 'contains' method for the Node
    class. Contains should accept a 'data' argument
    and return the Node in the tree with the same value.
